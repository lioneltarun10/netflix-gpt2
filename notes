npx create-react-app netflix-gpt2
npm start or npm run start
Let's setup our project.
Tailwindcss

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

(see tailwindcss website on how to setup tailwindcss for create-react-app )

After this we will discuss what features to build

# Features
- Login/Sign up
  - Sign In/ Sign Up form
  - redirect to browse page
- Browse page (after authentication)
 - Header
 - Main Movie
   - Trailer in background
   - Title & Description
   - Movie Suggestions
    - MovieLists * N
 - NetflixGPT 
  - Search Bar
  - Movie suggestions 

  Then let's create some basic components for our project like Browse, header , Body , Login , etc.

  Now let's setup routing
  npm i -D react-router-dom

  We have setup our routing
  Now let's create a login form 
  Login is done , let's create sign up
  But do we need new form for sign up or can we convert smae form to sign up form?

  We can convert same form to sign up form.

  Now our form needs validations. Whenever we need  a big form for our application, we can use FORMIK library. It is very good to build form inside react applications ,and easy to handle validations.

  Now we will not use FORMIK , we will write validations on our own.
