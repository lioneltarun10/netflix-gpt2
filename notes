npx create-react-app netflix-gpt2
npm start or npm run start
Let's setup our project.
Tailwindcss

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

(see tailwindcss website on how to setup tailwindcss for create-react-app )

After this we will discuss what features to build

# Features
- Login/Sign up
  - Sign In/ Sign Up form
  - redirect to browse page
- Browse page (after authentication)
 - Header
 - Main Movie
   - Trailer in background
   - Title & Description
   - Movie Suggestions
    - MovieLists * N
 - NetflixGPT 
  - Search Bar
  - Movie suggestions 

  Then let's create some basic components for our project like Browse, header , Body , Login , etc.

  Now let's setup routing
  npm i -D react-router-dom

  We have setup our routing
  Now let's create a login form 
  Login is done , let's create sign up
  But do we need new form for sign up or can we convert smae form to sign up form?

  We can convert same form to sign up form.

  Now our form needs validations. Whenever we need  a big form for our application, we can use FORMIK library. It is very good to build form inside react applications ,and easy to handle validations.

  Now we will not use FORMIK , we will write validations on our own.

  We will be using useRef hook for validations.

  We will create a seperate utility called validate.js to validate our form data. So that the login.js is kept simple.

  Now we created checkValidData function in validate.js , we can use it in our handleButtonClick function in Login.js.
  But how will we get email and password typed in the input box? one way is to use state variables for email and passowrd , so when user types something , it constantly updates the state variables. 
  Other way is to use useRef hook which references the email inpu box and password input box. Reference is created by react using useRef hook.

  vALIDATIONS writing is done , now we will do authentication of our app.

  We will use google firebase for authentication and also we will host our app in firebase itself.

  Steps for deployment

  1)Install forebase CLI - 'npm install -g firebase-tools'
2) firebase login - 'firebase login'
3) initialize firebase - 'firebase init' , then select hosting
(before 4th step , do 'npm run build' to build our project for production deployment)
4) Deploy command - 'firebase deploy'


Reading authentication is the super power of a developer.

We will read documentation and setup our user signup .

Latest of firebase is to use "web modular api" , don't use "web namespaced api"

We can see in firebase authentication docs , that the line
const auth = getAuth()

is used everywhere , that's why we will keep this line at a central place , instead of writing this line twice for signIn and signUp.

We have written code for signIn / SignUp.
Now once the user is signed In or signed Up , we will store our user details in redux store and also navigate to browse page.
